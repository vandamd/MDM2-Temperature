# Mathematical and Data Modelling 2 (MDM1) - Report 2

## Modelling a Central Heating System of Architecture

### Goal

The goals of this project were to:

- Create a model of a typical ducted air heating system that a client can install.
- Create a model that can be used to investigate the likely performance of variants that could be offered to customers.
- The system needs to be able to handle different sizes and shapes of buildings.
- The system should be able to keep the whole house warm even when the wind howls around it.
